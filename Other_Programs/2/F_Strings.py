# Some dummy variables
var_1 = 37
var_2 = 2.57
var_3 = True

# Using f-strings
print(
    f"Your weight is {var_1} kgs, your height is {var_2} m and your are super is {var_3}")

# f-strings are very useful to print the contents of variables and not worry about data types of variables and converting them to string to print
